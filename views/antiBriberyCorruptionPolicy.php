                        <p>Mega Trustee Berhad (“the Company”) is licensed and regulated by the Central Bank of Malaysia
                            (“BNM”) and the Securities Commission of Malaysia (“SC”). With the coming into force of
                            Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act, the Company’s Anti-Bribery and
                            Corruption Policy (“the Policy”) provides guidance to employees and its stakeholders on how
                            to recognize and deal with improper solicitation, bribery and any other corruption
                            activities and issues that may arise in the course of business.</p>
                        <p>This Policy is intended to provide employees with a basic introduction on how to avoid and
                            combat bribery and corruption in furtherance of Company’s commitment to lawful and ethical
                            behavior at all times. The Policy is applicable to all employees and directors (executive
                            and non-executive) under the Company and including their immediate family members.
                            Additionally, the policy extends to all service providers, contractors, subcontractors,
                            consultants, representatives and any other external parties performing work or services for
                            or on behalf of the Company (the “employees and associates”).</p>
                        <p>The Company has adopted a “No Gift” Policy whereby, subject only to specified exceptions, all
                            employees and associates acting for or on behalf of the Company are prohibited from,
                            directly or indirectly receiving and/or providing gifts.</p>
                        <p>It is the responsibility of employees and directors to inform external parties involved in
                            any business dealings that our company practices a “No Gift Policy” and to request the
                            external party for their understanding and attentiveness for and adherence to this policy.
                        </p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the rules set here, the principle that employees and associates should be
                            guided by is this:</p>
                        <p>“We accept goods or services of good quality without the need to have additional incentives
                            for our own personal benefit. Any offer that in your view will compromise or influence the
                            way you decide in a transaction for the Company should not be accepted”.</p>
